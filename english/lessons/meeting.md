# Making things clear
  * **You've probably wonder why...** ( I made this... )
  * **Sorry I missed that. Could you say it again?**
  * **Can I get this clear? You're saying that ...**
  * **How did you arrive at sth...** (How did you reach decission / solution etc)
  * **What exactly do you mean by '*term*'?**
  * **Correct me if I'm wrong**
  * **Please allow me to explain**
  * **Could you be a more specific?**
  * **So in other words**
  * **Perhaps I haven't explained myself clearly**
  * **What I meant was that ...**
  * **Could I just say sth?**
  * **What I was trying to say was that...**
  * **Sorry I didn't understand. Can you explain that again?**
  * :bangbang: **Can you run through that again?** ( explain quickly )
  * :bangbang: **Can you go over that again?** (repeat it in order that I can understand it)
  * **No, sorry, there's been a slight misunderstanding**
  * **Let me say it another way**

# Interupt
  * **Can I come in here?**
  * **I'd like to make a point**

# Prevent interuption
  * **Actually, if you could just let me finish…**
  * **Just let me finish, if you wouldn't mind…**
  * **Actually, I've nearly finished…**

# Problem solving
  * **There are several ways we could deal with it**
  * **I'd like to open up the discussion and hear your views**
  * **Yes, I suppose you're right**
  * **That sounds like a good idea, but I don't think it would work in practice**
  * **Let's look at the pros and cons**
  * **On the one hand ... but on the other hand**
  * **Can I make a suggestion? Instead of _____ing sth_ ... why don't we _do sth_**
  * **Let's think carefully about implications of that**
  * **In general it sounds like a good idea, although ...**
  * **I think the best way forward is to ...**

| Make a suggestion        | Accept a suggestion             | Reject a suggestion                     |
| ---                      | ---                             | ---                                     |
| Why don't we...          | That sounds like a good idea    | I don't think it would work in practise |
| What about... ?          | Yes that would work really well | I'm not really sure about that          |
| Shall we ... ?           | OK, Let's do that!              | That's a complete waste of time         |
| Can I make a suggestion? | That might be worth trying.     | I can see one or two problems with that |
